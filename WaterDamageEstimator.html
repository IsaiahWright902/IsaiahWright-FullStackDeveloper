                United Water Restoration Group needed an app that was quick and helped sell cash jobs. Doing an estimate
                off of scope sheet could take anywhere from 20-30 minutes, not to mention it also needed to be accurate.
                Making an estimate is hard, theres a lot to think about and the last thing you want to do is give
                someone an inaccurate information.

                With the help of
                the Water Damage Estimator, technicians can now create a much more accurate estimate in an average time
                of 5
                minutes. All the
                technician needs to do is put in the measurements of the room they are working in and answer a few
                questions and this
                application will automatically calculate how much equipment they will need. It will also automatically
                calculate how
                much the job will cost and put it into a format that can be shown to a customer.

                Using Auth0 we can ensure that only our employees see customer information. Estimates are not rendered
                unless a user is
                logged in. A user is also not allowed to create a new Damaged Home or Damaged Room unless they are
                authenticated first.

                UWRG Water Damage Estimator has three different types of roles; User, Moderator and Admin. Roles have
                allowed us to add
                functionality to give users different permissions within the application.

            <p class="section-text ">
                UWRG Water Damage Estimator has access which controls what a user sees. Access controls what a user sees
                and what the
                API returns with. This allows us to support a wide range of locations in one application. A user can
                only see estimates
                in their access. Admins can see all accessâ€™. Every single Access also has its own price list that can be
                edited by the
                moderator of that access.

                User management has been made easy in UWRG Water Damage Estimator. In the admin control panel you are
                able to look up
                users by name, edit users accounts, and delete users accounts. Editing user information was designed to
                be as easy as
                possible, in UWRG Water Damage Estimator you can change user settings with a few button clicks.

            <p class="section-text ">
                UWRG Water Damage Estimator can accurately calculate the volume and square footage of a room, standing
                water in liters
                and gallons, the number of Dehumidifiers needed, the number of Air Movers needed by area and linear
                feet, and the number
                of Air Scrubbers needed. Once all the rooms are finished being calculated in a Damaged Home they are
                totaled
                automatically in the total tab. The total tab automatically calculates all other services we charge for
                based off of the
                Damaged Rooms in a Damaged Home.

                UWRG Water Damage Estimator was designed to look good on anything. UWRG Water Damage supports formatting

                Unfortunatley I cannot go into more detail about how powerfull the Water Damage Estimator Really is. I
                really enjoyed working on this project, it was a lot of fun to figure out the restoration industry and
                make something that helps people on a daily basis. This project was quite the challenge too. I worked on
                it solo and in a way it became my baby. I was responsible for the front-end and back-end development of
                this project so I know the ins and outs of the entire application. Watching it grow to handle more and
                more has been nothing less
                than fantasitic. I am proud to say I have created something that has met and surpassed the goals
                originally
                planned for it. I cant wait to see what other challenges I will face in the future.
